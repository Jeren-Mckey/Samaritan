# Samaritan
Samaritan is a simple, console based, written morse code encryption and decryption program. 
It allows the user to enter some text in english and encrypt that english text into morse code and save that new text
into a separate file. The same program can also be used to decrypt morse code text files that were created using the
same program. In order to save the encrypted message as a file do not enter a .txt extension after the filename; the program handles 
the filename itself.
